- There is a task list in my log book, but as I don't have it. the tasks below is what will be worked on

Task list for Monday:

	+ Work on Report
	+ Brainstorm different simple calculations to perform on the 
	  delays
	+ look into syncwatch some more
	+ 

Simple Calculations
==================

- histogram of delays
- plot of delay with time
- histogram of delay colour plot (what Watson has done)
- 

Packet Metrics / Simple Calculations
====================================

- a few functions were made to implement the functions above.
- data will be passed to these functions instead of relying on global scope
- added in 3 arguments for each function
- currently I'm creating both MATIE and TDEV plots for histogram. this may be changed at a later date
- Plotting delays and histograms to a new folder and filename. sample size and test number is in the file name
