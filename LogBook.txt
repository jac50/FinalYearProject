Monday 17th March

- left logbook at home. writing log book on computer
- Watson is not on campus half way through the week
- There is a task list in my log book, but as I don't have it. the tasks below is what will be worked on

Task list for Monday:

	+ Work on Report
	+ Brainstorm different simple calculations to perform on the 
	  delays
	+ look into syncwatch some more
	+ 

Simple Calculations
==================

- histogram of delays
- plot of delay with time
- histogram of delay colour plot (what Watson has done)
- 

Packet Metrics / Simple Calculations
====================================

- a few functions were made to implement the functions above.
- data will be passed to these functions instead of relying on global scope
- added in 3 arguments for each function
- currently I'm creating both MATIE and TDEV plots for histogram. this may be changed at a later date
- Plotting delays and histograms to a new folder and filename. sample size and test number is in the file name

+ Saving of the delay variable now exists.

+ Coloured histogram plot is being worked on. 
+ plots something that looks like it. I need the vertical data though.. have emailed watson.

Tuesday 18th March
==================

- aim for today is to get some of the report done. 
- will also look into some of the other simple calculations that could be performed. 
	+ stddev, mean, median, mode, variance.
	 	+ implemented all functions 
 
- will focus on report today. need to get a chunk of it done.
- finished some sections, but will need to ask Watson about if I need to expand the introduction

Wednesday 19th March
====================

- late start today - will work until 8pm or so.
- aiming to get part of the method section of the report completed. 
- will also note down what diagrams and pictures are required.
- need to create images of the outside and inside of the TimePort, BeagleBOne, and the Syncwatch
